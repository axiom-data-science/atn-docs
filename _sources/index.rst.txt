Welcome to the Animal Telemetry Network
=======================================

The Integrated Ocean Observing System Animal Telemetry Network (IOOS ATN) is designed to serve as an access point to search, discover and access animal telemetry data, and associated oceanographic datasets, from a wide variety of species and platforms. The concept behind this website was put forth in the `ATN White Paper <https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/ATN/docs/Animal_Biotelemetry_ATN_Paper_2016-1.pdf>`_ document, entitled, *Toward A U.S. Animal Telemetry Observing Network (US ATN) For Our Oceans, Coasts and Great Lakes.*
