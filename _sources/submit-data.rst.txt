How to Submit Data
==================

Depending on your project funding and other factors, you may need to submit pre-deployment metadata and post-deployment metadata for your project. To do this, use the ``ATN Tag Deployment Metadata Template`` as described in the steps below.

.. note::

	You will need a `Research Workspace <https://researchworkspace.com/>`_ account to submit metadata. If you haven't created one yet, please see the `Creating & Accessing an Account <https://researchworkspace.com/help/CreatingAccountTutorial.html>`_ tutorial.

Deployment Metadata
-------------------

Pre-Deployment Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Log in to your Research Workspace account.
#. Navigate to your project.
#. Click on the ``Metadata template`` folder in the folder tree on the left.
#. Download either the XLSX or CSV version of the ``ATN Tag Deployment Metadata Template`` file (whichever format your prefer to work with; both files are the same).
#. Fill in the first 5 columns (Columns A-F, which have a green background in the XLSX file) with information for each tag (1 row per tag).
#. Save the file somewhere easy to find on your computer.
#. Upload the completed file to the ``Data`` folder of your project in the Research Workspace.

Post-Deployment Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Download the pre-deployment metadata file you uploaded in the steps above.
#. Fill in the remaining columns (F-P, shaded blue in the XLSX file) with deployment information (1 row per tag).
#. Save the file somewhere easy to find on your computer.
#. Upload the completed file to the ``Data`` folder of your project in the Research Workspace.

The ATN DAC has agreements in place to process data from the following vendors and service providers:

- Wildlife Computers
- Argos
- SMRU
- *More coming soon!*

If you use any of the above vendors you may :ref:`contact-us` to get started. You will need to send a confirmation to the vendor that you would like your data made available to the ATN DAC before we can start downloading and processing anything. **None of your data will be made public until after the embargo date**.

Post-Deployment Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recovered data can be submitted to the IOOS ATN by uploading it to the `Research Workspace <https://researchworkspace.com/>`_ by following these steps:

#. Create a `Research Workspace <https://researchworkspace.com/>`_ account
#. Navigate to your project
#. Upload your data files

The ATN DAC will accept any data that you would like to upload to your project. We would prefer the "rawest" form of data and will work with you to produce each level of ATN :ref:`data-levels`. **None of your data will be made public until after the embargo date**. For assistance submitting data to the IOOS ATN, see the Research Workspace `help docs <https://researchworkspace.com/help/>`_, consult the tutorials listed below, or :ref:`contact-us`.
