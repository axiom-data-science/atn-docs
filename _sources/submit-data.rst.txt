How to Submit Data
==================

Any researcher from the animal telemetry community is welcome to submit data to the ATN DAC. Contributing your data to the ATN DAC is a way to share your research with the general public, as well as other researchers in the animal telemetry community and beyond.

Additionally, submitting data to the ATN DAC may help you meet funding obligations for public data sharing, including federal Public Access to Research Results (PARR) requirements.

For help following the steps below, please contact Megan McKinzie, the ATN Data Coordinator, at mmckinzie@mbari.org.

Data Submitted through a Satellite Tag Vendor
---------------------------------------------

If your telemetry data can be made available to the ATN DAC through a satellite tag vendor (e.g., Wildlife Computers), follow these steps:

Step 1: Register your tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Visit the ATN DAC Registration page here: ``https://dacregistration.atn.ioos.us/``
#. Sign up for an account (or log in if you already have one)
#. Click ``New Project Metadata``
#. Using the form, enter your project-level metadata (i.e., Title, Abstract, Purpose, and Contact info)
#. Using the form, enter the information for each deployment associated with that project (e.g., PTT, species, deployment start/stop date/time)

After you submit this information, the ATN Data Coordinator will review your project and contact you with questions.

Step 2: Grant the ATN DAC access to your data feeds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Contact your tag vendor (e.g., Wildlife Computers)
#. Authorize the ATN DAC account to access the data feeds

Once your project and deployment metadata have been finalized, your project will appear in the ATN DAC Data Portal.

.. note::
	Data feeds made available to the ATN DAC while a tag is actively deployed on an animal will appear in the ``Real-time tag deployments`` layer in the ATN Data Portal's map interface. These feeds will also be listed as associated with your project in the ATN Data Portal's project catalog.

Data Submitted Directly to the DAC
----------------------------------

If your data aren't available from a satellite tag vendor, you can still submit to the ATN DAC through the following steps:

#. Visit the ATN DAC's data management platform, the `Research Workspace <https://researchworkspace.com/>`_
#. Create an account (or log in if you already have one)
#. Create a new project
#. Upload your data files
#. Work with the ATN Data Coordinator to publish your data files

.. note::
	Uploading data files to the Workspace will allow you to publish your data to the ATN DAC Data Portal project catalog, as well as archive your dataset with `DataONE <https://dataone.org/>`_. Depending on the format of your data, it may also be possible to display them in the ATN DAC Data Portal map. Contact the ATN Data Coordinator for more information.

For assistance submitting data to ATN DAC through the Research Workspace, please visit the Workspace's `help docs <https://researchworkspace.com/help/>`_, consult the tutorials listed below, or :ref:`contact-us`.
